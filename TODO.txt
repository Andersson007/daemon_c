(done) 1. Implement lock of log_queue when Logger is writing
    1.1. To think about a mechanism to push a log message
        to local buffer / another (spare) log queue when log_queue is locking
    1.2. Remove mutex from to_log_queue() to avoid mutual affection (e.g. when
        disks are slow, etc.). Probably we mustn't wait in this case and
        not to send messages to the queue
    1.3. Logger will sleep for a certain time between checking the queue
2. When the control process get an appropriate signal
    2.1. Send signals to forks to finish work and exit (now it is only Logger)
    2.2. Finishes itself
    2.3. Processes mustn't wait for signals in loops, just check each iteration
